Waystones converts geospatial data models into production-ready OGC API and WMS services. The tool generates deployment kits that use a snapshot architecture: source data (GeoPackage, PostGIS) is converted once to static GeoParquet and FlatGeobuf files, which are then served by pygeoapi and QGIS Server respectively.


## ✨ Key Features

### 🚀 Visual Data Modeler
**Build geospatial schemas with an interactive editor.**
- **Inheritance & Reusability**: Link layers via inheritance to share field definitions and constraints.
- **Shared Types**: Define custom field types once and reuse them across your entire project.
- **Real-time Validation**: Interactive feedback ensures your model is always standards-compliant.
- **Dynamic Styling**: Built-in Layer Style Editor for consistent cartography across WMS and OGC API services.

### 🍱 Deployment Kit Generation
**Generate production-ready OGC API and WMS services.**
- **Automated Configuration**: Generates `pygeoapi` (REST) and **QGIS Server** (WMS) configurations.
- **Cloud-Optimized Streaming**: Kits serve static GeoParquet/FlatGeobuf from local disk or stream directly from S3/R2 via HTTP Range Requests. No heavy database connections, no massive file downloads into memory.
- **Self-Contained Kits**: Deployment kits include all necessary Dockerfiles and boot scripts.
- **Multiple Targets**: Deploy to Docker Compose, Railway, Render, Fly.io, or Waystones Cloud.
- **Metadata Support**: Built-in support for **STAC** (SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog) catalogs.

### 🔍 GitHub Integration
**Version control and collaborative workflows.**
- **Interactive Review**: Compare changes visually with integrated Git diffs before pushing.
- **OAuth Integration**: Securely browse and manage your repositories directly from the UI.
- **PR Workflows**: Push directly to branches or create Pull Requests for collaborative review.

### 🤖 AI-Powered Assistant
**Automate metadata and schema generation.**
Connect Claude or Gemini to auto-generate metadata, field descriptions, and infer constraints from your sample data.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| **Frontend** | React 19, TypeScript, Vite 6 |
| **Geospatial** | GDAL3.js, jszip, js-yaml, STAC |
| **Icons** | Lucide React |
| **Sources** | PostGIS (pg), Supabase, GeoPackage |
| **Engines** | pygeoapi, QGIS Server |
| **Deployment** | Docker, Railway, GitHub Actions |

## 🚀 Getting Started

Waystones is designed for Node.js 22+.

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` and start modeling.

### ⚙️ Environment Variables

For full functionality, copy `.env.example` to `.env` (if it exists) or manually configure:

```env
# GitHub OAuth (required for GitHub integration)
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your_github_oauth_app_id
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your_github_oauth_app_secret
VITE_GITHUB_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/auth/callback

# Optional: AI Assistant (Claude or Gemini)
VITE_DEFAULT_AI_KEY=your_api_key_here
VITE_DEFAULT_AI_PROVIDER=claude  # or 'gemini'
```

The app includes a small Express server (`server.js`) that proxies GitHub OAuth and handles PostGIS schema imports. In development, `npm run dev` starts both Vite and the server automatically.

## 🏗 Architecture

Waystones uses a **Snapshot Architecture**. Source data is converted to cloud-native formats (`GeoParquet`, `FlatGeobuf`) during deployment. These static files are then served by specialized, high-performance engines without a live database connection.

```text
[ 1. CONVERSION ]
GeoPackage / PostGIS → [ Worker ] → GeoParquet & FlatGeobuf (S3/R2/Disk)

[ 2. STARTUP (boot.sh) ]
Container Start ──┬──> [ Fast Path ] ─> Download pre-baked OpenAPI cache
                  ├──> [ Slow Path ] ─> Serve placeholder + Background generation
                  ├──> [ Gunicorn  ] ─> EXECs pygeoapi (Internal Port 5001)
                  └──> [ Warmup    ] ─> Background DuckDB/Parquet pre-warming (5s delay)

[ 3. SERVING ]
pygeoapi (DuckDB) ───> [ GeoParquet ] ───> OGC API Features (N-workers)
QGIS Server       ───> [ FlatGeobuf ] ───> WMS (Fast CGI)
```

The conversion worker typically runs once on first boot or during a CI/CD build, persisting data to immutable storage. pygeoapi and QGIS Server then read those static files at serve time.

### 🚀 Key Components

- **Hybrid Boot Strategy**: 
  - **Fast Path**: In SaaS environments, containers download a pre-baked OpenAPI document for instant service availability.
  - **Slow Path**: In local development, a placeholder is served while the document is generated in the background.
- **Background Warm-up**: The `warmup.py` process runs as a low-priority background task to pre-fill DuckDB caches and fetch Parquet footers from S3/R2, ensuring sub-second response times even on cold boots.
- **Snapshot Worker**: Automated conversion pipeline (GDAL/DuckDB) that transforms live databases or GeoPackages into optimized static formats, enabling the snapshot architecture.
- Dual Engines:

pygeoapi: High-performance RESTful access via DuckDB, reading GeoParquet via zero-copy streaming (over network or local storage).

QGIS Server: High-fidelity map rendering serving FlatGeobuf natively from cloud storage or local disk.
- **CI/CD Driven**: Built-in GitHub Actions workflows automate data conversion and kit packaging.

### 🐳 Docker Configuration
The Waystones Docker images support advanced configuration via environment variables:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `PORT` | `5000` | The public port for the service. |
| `DEPLOY_PYGEOAPI` | `1` | Set to `0` to run in Gateway-only mode (Caddy only). |
| `DEPLOY_SIDE_GATEWAY` | `0` | Set to `1` to enable the Caddy sidecar (proxies to pygeoapi on 5001). |
| `CONTAINER_WORKERS` | `2` | Number of Gunicorn worker processes. |
| `WARMUP_DELAY` | `5` | Seconds to wait before background GeoParquet warming. |
